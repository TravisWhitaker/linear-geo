# linear-geo

Geographic coordinates, built on the linear package.

This package provides types and functions for dealing with coordinates in
geodetic, ECEF, and ENU coordinate systems. A particular emphasis is placed on
numerical stability, especially for complex conversions like converting between
geodetic and ECEF coordinates. However, not every part of every function has
machine checked for numerical stability.
